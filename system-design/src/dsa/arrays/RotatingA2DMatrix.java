Given an nxn two-dimensional matrix of numbers, rotate the matrix 90 degrees to the right (clockwise).
Example 1
In
[
  [ 1,  2,  3, 4],
  [ 5,  6,  7, 8],
  [ 9, 10, 11, 12],
  [13, 14, 15, 16]
]

Out
[
 [13,  9, 5, 1],
 [14, 10, 6, 2],
 [15, 11, 7, 3],
 [16, 12, 8, 4]
]

Challenge : Can you do the rotation in-place?
